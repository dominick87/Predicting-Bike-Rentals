# Predicting-Bike-Rentals

In this project, we'll try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. We'll predict the `cnt` column using all of the other columns, except for `casual` and `registered`. To accomplish this, we'll create a few different machine learning models (such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest) and evaluate their performance.

The dataset can be downloaded [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset), or you can find it into the repository folder as well.
